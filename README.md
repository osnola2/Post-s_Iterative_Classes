# Post-s_Iterative_Classes
It is a naive and brute force way to determine the iteratively closed sets of up to 3-ary truth-functions, which are in effect the finite part of the (less than it should be) famous result of Emil Post on the determination of the iteratively closed sets of two-valued functions. For now it is mostly a backup: it is a mess and the computer hosting it is facing toubles, but it works.
